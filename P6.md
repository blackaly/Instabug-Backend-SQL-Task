P6. For the same table in P4, find the title of the bug with token = "token660" and reported_at on "2020-08-30". 
This problem is graded partially, 10% on correctness (your query gets the correct count) and 90% on performance (your query makes use of available indexes). 

***Scored 10% only***
```
SELECT COUNT(x.created_at) AS count 
FROM bugs AS y 
USE INDEX (PRIMARY,index_bugs_on_category_and_token_and_reported_at) 
INNER JOIN bugs AS x ON x.id=y.id WHERE x.created_at >= '2019-03-01'
```
