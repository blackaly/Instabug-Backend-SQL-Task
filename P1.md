P1. Given 3 tables, students(id, name) , courses(id, name) , grades(id, course_id, student_id, grade), find the top 100 students based on their average grades sorted descendingly by the average grade and in case multiple students have the same average grade, sort them lexicographically in ascending order by their names. Your query should output a table with the following columns (name, average_grade).Submission endpoint:
```
SELECT DISTINCT student_id, students.name, avg(grade) FROM grades
INNER JOIN students ON students.id = grades.student_id
GROUP BY student_id
ORDER BY avg(grade) DESC, LENGTH(students.name) ASC, students.name ASC

```
