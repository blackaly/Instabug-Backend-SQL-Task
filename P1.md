P1. Given 3 tables, students(id, name) , courses(id, name) , grades(id, course_id, student_id, grade), 

find the top 100 students based on their 

average grades sorted descendingly by the average grade and in case multiple students have the same average grade, 
sort them lexicographically in ascending order by their names. 

Your query should output a table with the following columns (name, average_grade).Submission endpoint:
```
SELECT DISTINCT students.name AS name, avg(grade) AS average_grade FROM grades
RIGHT JOIN students ON students.id = grades.student_id
GROUP BY students.name
ORDER BY avg(grade) DESC, students.name ASC
LIMIT 100
```
