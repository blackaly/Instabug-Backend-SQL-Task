P3. For the same tables in P1, get the name of the most popular course (the one where the most students are enrolled) and if there is a tie, get the course that's lexicographically the smallest
```
SELECT c.name
FROM courses c
INNER JOIN grades g ON g.course_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, c.name
LIMIT 1;
```
