For the same tables in P1, for each student, get all the courses that he/she is enrolled in along with the grade he/she scored for each course.
Order the result by the student name in ascending order and if there is a tie, break it with the course name in ascending order and
if there is a tie break it with the grade in ascending order. The final result should have 3 columns with names (name, course, grade).
Submission endpoint:
```
SELECT DISTINCT student.name AS name,course.title AS course, grades.grade AS grade 
FROM ((grades
INNER JOIN student ON student.id = grades.students_id
INNER JOIN course ON course.id = grades.courses_id))
ORDER BY student.name ASC, course.title ASC, grades.grade ASC
```
